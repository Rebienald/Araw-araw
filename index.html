        The song Araw-Araw is about loving someone every single day. </br> It’s about choosing them again and again, no matter what happens. </br>The song expresses how being with that person makes life better and more meaningful.
</p>
<p>
    Even though we were apart for two years, your love never wavered, and it’s still the same. Thank you for <br>
    being my girl, and thank you for choosing me again. I love you so much. I promise that you will always <br>
    be my araw araw, the girl I will choose every single day, the girl I will love unconditionally, the girl who <br>
    will be my forever, and the girl I loved and will continue to love the most. I love you, my araw araw. <br>
